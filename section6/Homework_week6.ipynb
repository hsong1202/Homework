    "\n",
    "# 1.\tCreate a definitive problem statement to be solved with data analytics.  \n",
    "# •\tYour statement needs to be written.\n",
    "# •\t The statement should be 1-3 sentences.\n",
    "# •\tProvide a brief overview of the topic if context is necessary to help understand the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.\tProvide your datasets.\n",
    "# •\tIn .csv / sql format\n",
    "# •\t-or- a website that will be accessed with webscraping/API.  If possible, include the Python code to be used for accessing this data.\n",
    "# •\tProvide an explanation of the datasets you submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.\tDescribe your plan on how to use this data to answer your problem statement. \n",
    "# •\tCreate a brief write-up (typically 3-5 sentences) describing your plan of what you intend to do with that data to solve your question.\n",

    "# Context:  With the increase in Electric vehicle sales in the United States, clearly some states are quicker to adopt this technology than others.  Why is this?  Do the above factors influence purchasing of such vehicles?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The problem statement above will be addressed by considering which U.S. states have more electric vehicles registered than other states, and if those listed factors influence these patterns.\n",

    "# This is a three-part approach.  \n",
    "# Step 1: I will use mv1.xlsx to compare the number of registered electric vehicles to the number of total vehicle registrations.  I will do this using Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Step 2: Joins.   To be done with SQL and/or Python.\n",
    "# I will join the resulting table from Step 1 with StateTemperatures to see if there is a correlation between EV registrations and temperatures (Do warmer temperatures equate to more EV sales?)\n",
    "# I will do the same to join Step 1 results with EVincentivesByState.\n",
    "# I will do an additional join using Step 1 results with h08 table data to identify correlations between EV registrations and median income.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time permitting, I will also compare EV registrations with Top 5% income earners by state to see if that shows a different result (EVs are, in general, expensive, and using top income levels instead of median income could give a different result).  \n",
    "# After doing the above joins, data visualization in Tableau will help identify correlations between datasets.\n",
